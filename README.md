# BlackBoard-Autologger

A python based application that automatically logs in into your accounts and attends your classes on ```cuchd.blackboard.com``` website. I wrote this script STRICTLY for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES and I am NOT RESPONSIBLE for any **non-disciplinary** action commited by its users, i.e., all the students of Chandigarh University (yes, **ALL**, not just CSE or AIT !)

With that being said, let's get right into it, shall we ?

## Installation

Download or clone this repository in your PC and extract.

To use the program, you only need to run the ```runMe.bat``` file

On first run, it will execute the setup which will ask for your credentials and your weekly timetable, which you need to put in the prompt opened **and not the browser itself**. Don't worry the software is very interactive and you'll have no problem setting it up on your Windows PC. 

## Usage

So you're done with the installation. But, how do you use it? It's really simple actually, you run the same ```runME.bat``` and voila, you're in your class. *It's recommended that you don't interact with the browser window while it's connecting but, meh. Do what you want !*

In theory this will log in onto BlackBoard and join you're class according to the timetable provided by you while the installation.
